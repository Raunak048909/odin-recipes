    <p>Kebab[a] (UK: /kɪˈbæb/ kib-AB, US: /kɪˈbɑːb/ kib-AHB), kebap, kabob (alternative North American spelling), kebob, or kabab (Kashmiri spelling) is a variety of roasted meat dishes that originated in the Middle East.</p>
    <p>Kebabs consist of cut up ground meat, sometimes with vegetables and various other accompaniments according to the specific recipe. Although kebabs are typically cooked on a skewer over a fire, some kebab dishes are oven-baked in a pan, or prepared as a stew such as tas kebab.[3][4] The traditional meat for kebabs is most often lamb meat, but regional recipes may include beef, goat, chicken, fish, or even pork (depending on whether or not there are specific religious prohibitions).</p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g minced meat (chicken, beef, or lamb)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion (grated and squeezed)</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves (minced)</li>
        <li>1-inch ginger (minced)</li>
        <li>1 green chili (optional, chopped)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp fresh coriander or mint (chopped)</li>
        <li>–2 tbsp gram flour (besan) or breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp coriander powder</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grate the onion and squeeze out excess water. Finely chop the garlic, ginger, chili, and fresh herbs.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the minced meat with all the chopped ingredients, spices, salt, lemon juice, and gram flour. Mix everything well with your hands and let it rest for 20–30 minutes.</li>
